MVC architecture using GetX
  * `Model` refers to all the data and its related logic.
  * `View` Present data to the user or handles user interaction 
    * Implemented using GetView/GetResponsiveView 
    * GetView is a constant statelessWidget, usually associated with a GetXController
    * GetResponsiveView is a screen-width depended widget associated with a GetXController and used in case of responsive UI design.
  * `Controller` refers to an interface between Model and View components 
    * Implemented using GetXController.
    * Consists of 3 life cycles.
      * onInit() : called when controllerâ€™s memory allocated
      * onReady() : called upon UI widgets appearing on screen
      * onClose() : called before the controller gets deleted from the memory
